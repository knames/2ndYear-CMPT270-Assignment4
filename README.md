2ndYear-CMPT270-Assignment4
===========================
This is my 4th Assignment for my CMPT 270 class. After it's been completed, I'll change it to Public (so I can use private again for my next assignment.

Status:
Everything is working. All methods requiring testing are tested 
assuming proper input is given. If inproper input is given, methods will
return error messages or throw exceptions. 

In retrospect, I should have had all of my input/output handled in my 
KennelSystem class, passing back arguments instead of each command handling
the IO itself, but I realized this too late to change with my busy work schedule.
